# Lazy Book Curator

### A short introduction to the project
### The project only consists of 3 main files
#### 1. 
#### 2.
#### 3.

### The .csv file was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cristaliss/ultimate-book-collection-top-100-books-up-to-2023). and was thoroughly cleaned to be classified into several different categories
#### 1. Title Name
#### 2. Title Author
#### 3. Year of Publish
#### 4. Length of book

## Initial plan for the project
To create a book application that can be used by users to provide a personalised recommendation of books based on their inputs for the categories mentioned above. However there were several challenges faced in the process of the creation therefore, we have reduced it to a web app with a similar function. The application is still in progress and we will continue developing it.
